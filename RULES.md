# Rejected Standards

By the time this document is being written, there are no "OPTIONAL" standards to be dismissed. The document itself was implemented as a response to [#3](https://std.floss.uz/0003-the-culture.html). Therefore, the document is subjected to changes in the future as soon as new standard comes out.

# Internal Rules

The paragraph defines current acting rules in our community. Our community rules are maintained and reviewed by our current acting chair [orzklv](https://github.com/orzklv) and maintainer [@zawkin](https://t.me/zawkin). The internal rules are implemented within our telegram assistant [@xinuxmgrbot](https://t.me/xinuxmgrbot) at `/rules` command which lets our users easily access list of all rules our community follows.

- Our telegram chat serves as a place to discuss about any topic within `Linux`'es domain and any topic about Nix, NixOS or nixpkgs is couraged.
- We decided to have topic based chat community where every direction in `Linux` domain has its own place to discuss. If there happens to be a person or a group of person discussing about something out of corresponding topic, hence messages has to be replied with /warn command following the topic or place it belongs to. If the context is something out of `Linux`'es domain, then it has to be directed to unified off-topic chat [@flossuzc](https://t.me/flossuzc).
- Heavy or aggressive criticism towards to acting chair and maintainer or community itself is discouraged. If there happens to be such case, chair or maintainer is allowed to temporarily or in the worst case scenario, indefinitely mute the person or a group of person that led to this case.
- Cursing or using offensive language is not welcomed anywhere at Xinux, let it be chat or GitHub organization.
- It is strongly recommended to do not repeate the same message, topic or context over and over. Instead, leave a link to earlier discussion or close topic if the topic seems to do not find any resolution. Excessive amount of repitition might result to temporary kick or mute by acting chair, maintainer or moderator.
